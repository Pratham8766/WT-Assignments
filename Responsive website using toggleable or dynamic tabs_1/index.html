          <h2>SDP</h2>

          <p>
            SDP stands for Software Development Project. It is a core subject in
            the curriculum of computer science and engineering at VIT. The
            purpose of this subject is to help students develop practical skills
            in software development, project management, and team collaboration.
            Students work in teams to design, develop, and test a software
            system that meets the requirements of a real-world client. The
            project is typically completed over two semesters and culminates in
            a final presentation to the client and a panel of faculty members.

          <p>
            Course Projects are a crucial part of the curriculum of computer
            science and engineering at VIT. They give students an opportunity to
            apply the concepts and skills they have learned in their courses to
            real-world problems. Students work in teams to design and develop a
            software system, or to conduct a research project under the guidance
            of a faculty member. The project culminates in a final presentation
            to a panel of faculty members and industry experts.
